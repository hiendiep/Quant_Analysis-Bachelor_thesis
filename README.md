+ Programming, Software Engineer
+ Academic Research

## 3. Served Stakeholder
Personal project for Bachelor graduation

## 4. Timeline
Mar - June 2024

## 5. Scope of Work
+ Simulate and inference the performance of 3,200 time-series trend-following strategies (over 4 classes: MA - MACD - RSI - Resistant/Support breakout)
+ Testing the significant of profit generated by  3,200 portfolio (12 currencies), and their performance against Buy-and-Hold across 2017-2024, using Stationary boostraping
+ Prevent data snooping bias by evaluating Breakeven Points, Bonferroni correction,...


## 6. Process and Approach
Input: 12 Currencies ticker price  
Output: Testing statistic of 3,200 strategy portfolio. See here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1h-Hgyuglj80sSApsC6JmyxRsRJNDnqgV/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=101905111734653218108&rtpof=true&sd=true  
Process and Features:
+ Data Loading: Retrieves historical price data for specified cryptocurrency tickers from a local Excel file 
+ Strategy Formulation: Develop MA, R&S, RSI, and MACD algorithm with customizable parameters.
+ Portfolio Construction: Forms equally-weighted portfolios rebalanced annually.
+ Performance Measurement: Calculates risk-adjusted returns and conducts statistical inference.
+ Inference Testing: Using stationary boostrapping
+ Robustness Test; Strategy breakeven point, Bonferroni correction.
+ Reporting: Generates detailed performance reports at ticker, strategy, and portfolio levels.

## 7. Outcome
+ Time series Trend followings strategies show insignificant positive return and underperform passive investment
+ This performance has degraded over time potentially due to market efficiency and crowded strategies.
+ Long-only portfolios consistently outperform long-short portfolios
